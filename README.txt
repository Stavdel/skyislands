===============================================================
Welcome to the Sky Island mod

I plan on adding a bunch of cool things to minecraft 1.19.4. If you're
interested check out the progress.txt file that will include all features
that I want to add for this mod. Maybe the list will expand over time. This
is going to be a project for me to understand how to work with larger codebases.


Objective:
  -Learn how to mod and get familiar with forge's codebase by registering custom
  features in the game.
  
  
Note:
  All the important files are in src/main as expected.
